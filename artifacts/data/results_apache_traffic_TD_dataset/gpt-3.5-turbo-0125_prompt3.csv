as of  tm will no longer overwrite its monitoringjson snapshot data with corresponding crconfig snapshot data if the monitoringjson contains ip addresses for the tms meaning it now has parity with the crconfig data however it still needs the crconfig in order to filter out delivery services from monitoringjson which arent present in the crconfig that was fixed in  in that the monitoringjson no longer contains delivery services from other cdns to which the tm doesnt belong

 traffic ops

 current behavior
the type of the response properties of response bodies from post requests to profileparameters in all api versions are odd if the array request format is used and multiple associations between profiles and parameters are created then the response will be
json

	alerts 
		
			text profileparameters were created
			level success
		
	
	response null



when creating a single association the response looks like

json

	alerts 
		
			text profileparameter was created
			level success
		
	
	response 
		lastupdated null
		profile null
		profileid 
		parameter null
		parameterid 
	



where presumably lastupdated is meant to be the time of the associations creation profile is probably meant to be the name of the profile identified by profileid and parameter could possibly be the name of the parameter identified by parameterid although thats not enough information to identify a parameter however all of these properties are always null

get requests return different representations of the associations in the form
json

	response 
		
			lastupdated  
			profile global
			parameter 
		
        



so profiles are identified by name and never id  however the filtering query parameters offered by that endpoint do not allow filtering by profile name only id parameters on the other hand are only presented as ids but use the property name parameter whereas the post response uses the property name parameterid to represent the same information  and the query parameter offered by the endpoint to filter by parameter id is likewise parameterid note that in get requests lastupdated is properly never null

 new behavior
the representation used for an object should not vary so wildly between requests and responses and between request methods of the same endpoint a single representation format must be chosen and used for all representations

according to the api guidelines the response should be a representation of the created objects therefore when something is created null is always an unacceptable response

likewise null is not a valid datetime value so it is always unacceptable as a value for lastupdated and similarly there is no point in always returning null for pieces of information that are redundant other identifiers exist useless fields andor the information is knowable at the time of the request which it is in the case of post requests as described above

finally though the  also state

 relationships should not be represented through the api as objects in their own right

so this endpoint really should not exist at all which would be a totally acceptable solution to this issue even if such an endpoint is desirable i would hesitate to say that being able to make assignments of more than one distinct parameter to more than one distinct profile is an unintuitive ux at best and is typically better accomplished using profilesidparameters andor parametersidprofiles instead in the case of bootstrapping an environment eg for testing the profiles and parameters must be created first anyway so using profile importing would be much easier and faster than using this method furthermore for manipulating associations between parameters and profiles we have

 parameterprofile
 profileparameter
 profileparameters
 profileparametersprofile idparameter id
 profilesidparameters
 profilesimport kinda
 profilesnamenameparameters

and were not even avoiding them the worse ones are still using the standard library



because we need fields not in the struct and sqlx isnt capable of that note the deepcachingtype in the above query

but this is possible and not even that difficult all we have to do is create a new struct which anonymously embeds the real struct like so


type createds struct 
  tcdeliveryservicenullable
  deepcachingtype string

createds  createdsdeliveryservicenullable ds deepcachingtype deepcachingtype
resultrows err  txstructscaninsertquery createds
ds  updatedsdeliveryservicenullable


as well as updating insertquery to use sqlx activeactive syntax rather than standard sql

 delivery service steeringregexps aka steering filters only apply to steering
 the json response format when using the query string formatjson varies slightly between steering and clientsteering

steering

location 

clientsteering

locations


that said if no clients of a steering delivery service use the above  features they should be able to smoothly transition to an equivalent clientsteering delivery service instead they will still get  by default but with clientsteering they will also receive the full result list of all targets which they could choose to ignore if the steering clients only care about the  ignore the response body and dont use formatjson then their experience shouldnt change between a steering delivery service and an equivalent clientsteering delivery service

however if the steering client depends on the specific json format provided via formatjson then they will need to be fixed to work with the clientsteering json format other than that we could add functionality to clientsteering to satisfy points  and  for steering clients that use those features still

i think a tentative plan would look like this
 add functionality for points  and  to clientsteering possibly if the community still relies on that obscure functionality
 deprecate steering in major release n  no new delivery services of type steering can be created but existing steering delivery services will continue to be supported delivery services of type clientsteering can be created and existing steering delivery services should be updated to use clientsteering instead
 in major release  remove support for steeringtype delivery services this would include removing the steering type from traffic ops removing nonclientsteering support in the crconfig and removing nonclientsteering support in traffic router by this point release  could probably include a db migration that automatically sets any remaining steering delivery services to clientsteering because everyone should have manually transitioned to clientsteering before release  anyways

114,"one of the first steps to self service change integrity is to change the crconfig to select the latest timestamps for each delivery service which requires all tables queried for the crconfig deliveryservices key insertnotupdate which requires those endpoints be written in go

the following tables are queried in the crconfig

 cachegroup
 cdn
 deliveryservice
 deliveryserviceregex
 deliveryserviceserver
 parameter
 profile
 profileparameter
 regex
 server
 staticdnsentry
 type
 status
 snapshot

this case is part of self service and represents the overarching task of rewriting those tables in go but individual issues and prs for each table should be in  

 if youve verified a route does not use one of the crconfig tables above follow it with a bullet noting that be sure to verify any tables the route does use do not link a crconfig table in those tables trafficopsapplibschemaresult
 if there is an unmerged pr follow with a bullet linking the pr
 if the route is in go in master check it off

note this checklist should be current as of  cachegroupfallbacks omitted because that functionality was added to the cachegroups endpoint

 current behavior


 the to api testing framework currently deletes all rows from certain tables before running some manual db queries to insert test data and running the actual tests some manual db queries are probably necessary to set up some targeted data in order to run the tests but we already have a thing to reset the db  dbadmin envtest reset this will get the db into an empty state at the latest schema version simply deleting all data without reinserting all the necessary starterseed data is a problem because traffic control depends on that starter data for some of its features toextensionsserverchecks for example
 the tcfixturesjson file  the json file that contains the to api test fixture data  overlaps significantly with the seedssql file that is used to seed the db with necessary data this is a problem because duplicate data is bound to get out of sync and seedssql should be the ssot for necessary starterseed data

 expected  new behavior


 the to api testing framework should use the dbadmin binary for resetting the db instead of doing it itself
 the to api testing framework should use seedssql for populating all the necessary starterseed data instead of duplicating all the same data in json form in tcfixturesjson

it seems like there should be three initial steps performed by the to api test framework
 run the dbadmin envtest reset to empty the totest db
 run targeted db queries to populate some required data that running seedssql alone would be insufficient things like creating the initial set of users that the tests will require to log in  it does some of this today but currently inserts data that could be inserted by seedssql instead 
 run seedssql to populate the db with the necessary starterseed data

there was already an issue opened by  for item   so ill add that description here as rationale for item 
 right now the to api tests dont use seedssql which has a number of issues
  the sql commands required by the tests have to be copypasted into the tests for example for capabilities this is  lines of duplicate code
  changes to seedssql will break the tests unless theyre also copypasted in
  changes to seedssql which change behavior could break an endpoint but the api tests will still pass because theyre copypasted
  the seedssql is not being tested ideally the to tests should verify that the seedssql works correctly as part of verifying to works
 
 the api test framework should be changed to use seedsql rather than copying its contents to fix these issues and improve test coverage in general

objects with names that are numbers can be created

 expected  new behavior

prevent creating objects with names that are numbers

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions

currently you can create objects  cdns profiles delivery services servers  basically any object whose name cdn name profile name ds xmlid server hostname etc these names can then be queried from api endpoints and clients expect to get a single response 

further many api endpoints accept either a name or id in the same path segment

what then happens when a user requests cdnsidorname for an object with a name which is a valid id of a different object

we should not do anything to break upon existing data if some traffic control user has names which are ids and is somehow using them successfully we should not cause them to break

but we should prevent new objects for every object type with a name from being created with a name that is strictly a number we have never supported that and it has never worked correctly with the api it is better to explicitly prohibit it and return an error when trying to create than to let users create it and get difficult errors when later using it

in the future for api  we could design an api which can unambiguously handle names that are numbers but the current api simply does not work with numeric names in numerous places both at the api and internal code level and so it should be prevented

136,"the to api defines post and put to return the object for most endpoints but the cruder framework doesnt it just returns an empty success response

i dont think itll be that difficult to make the cruder framework do this by adding it to the genericcreate and genericupdate funcs to expect an object to be returned from sql and populate it via the existing sqlx tags and add that to each query via returning

this might ought to be tagged bug its a bug that the api is missing this from  where it existed before",TD,TD

 cdninabox because of ortpy
 traffic ops ort and also the python version used by cdninabox

 current behavior
to fetch the packages necessary for install on cache servers ort calls the orthost namepackages endpoint which is not grounded in an api version nor documented anywhere nor handled in go

 expected  new behavior
ort should use only real documented supported versioned api endpoints im not personally very particular how thats done though i prefer the bottommost option unrealistic though that may be

• the call could be forwarded to atstccfg which could be updated to support generating the output from standard api calls
• ort itself could be changed to request the necessary information from the standard api
• the endpoint could be rewritten in go and added to the  api
• the ability to install packages could be removed from ort entirely and be left to the orchestration or administration system of choice for the organization managing the server  which probably does it better anyway

below is the result you can see that the error clearly returns the alert message im looking for but when an error occurs the client doesnt return the alerts at first glance this is confusing is there a particular reason this is done i believe there is a go convention that says a returned error implies the first value is nil but i dont think that makes sense in this case

i can write this particular test differently but maybe this makes sense to change

as far as i know only one type of type can be added dynamically  server types the other types are static and would require supporting code changes if new types are introduced

for example you can create an edgefoo or midfoo type and the system will treat those servers as edges and mids respectively because they start with edge or mid  no code changes required

however if you create a dnsfoo delivery service type the system cant handle that without code changes

therefore i think the crud apis for types should only work if useintableserver otherwise you should get back a  bad request",TD,TD

relatedly the dockercompose instructions on the same page have the same problem might be worth adding to the instructions a section on how go get the code and navigate to it ie

for many of these ie getupdatehostname there are api alternatives and any tc component ie ort that is using these routes needs to switch to the api alternative so the ui route can be disabled and eventually deleted

im also guessing that many of these are simply not used at all

and for the ones that are being used but no api alternative exists an api alternative should be create in routesgo

the main challenge to overcome for  is that  as well as trafficopsortpl relies on systemd in order to start and check the status of trafficserver systemd is relatively straightforward to use in a centos  docker container but not in centos  example of an error in a centos  docker container without systemd support

go
error   error verifying system services unable to enable service trafficserver error executing binsystemctl failed to get dbus connection no such file or directory


ideally we wouldnt need to use systemd in docker containers see  without a  flag to avoid systemd though the edge  and  services would need to  when built for either centos  or centos

278,"traffic ops golang riaksvc is currently hardcoded there are a very small number of functions we do on riak 

by moving riak to a plugin tc users will be able to use any secure database making it easy to move away from riak if it doesnt suit their use case 

it will also allow us to provide multiple secure db implementations in tc itself 

it will also allow us to implement a trivial file or memory db so users developing and testing tc could run without the additional work of setting up riak making developing debugging and trying out tc easier

i suggest implementing the plugin hook as a hook which runs on initialization and plugins return a securedb interface which implements the necessary functions to load and store keys",TD,TD

each changelog entry currently includes the following fields
typescript
export interface log 
	id number
	lastupdated date
	level apichange
	message string
	ticketnum null
	user string



 new behavior
ids have no purpose for changelog entries because they are immutable by nature level used to have meaning when changes could be made through either the nowremoved traffic ops ui or the api where it would show that distinction but that no distinction no longer exists and was always of questionable merit at any rate imo so im not sure historical preservation is a good reason to keep it around ticketnum has not only no known purpose but also theres no way to populate it so its just always null theres no reasonable way i can think of to make use of that field finally lastupdated is not necessarily useless its just a bad name imo a changelog entry is never updated it is only created

with all this in mind i propose a new format for logs output
typescript
export interface log 
	
	  this should be an  timestamp instead
	  of the custom format used today for lastupdated
	 
	date date
	message string
	user string

 traffic monitor

 current behavior


tm first requests the monitoring config snapshot then requests the crconfig snapshot in order to create its internal trafficmonitorconfigmap representation it currently overwrites the traffic monitor data in the monitoring snapshot with data from the crconfig snapshot most likely due to the monitoring config missing traffic monitor  and  addresses it will also fall back to using crconfig delivery service data if not present in the monitoring snapshot although this should no longer be an issue as of  since the monitoring config and crconfig are now snapshotted together this is entirely unnecessary

 new behavior

 traffic ops should populate the ip and  fields in the trafficmonitors array of the monitoring config snapshot instead of leaving them blank

      
        profile mytmprofile
        status online
        port 
        cachegroup foo
        hostname 
        fqdn examplecom
        ip 
         
      

 traffic ops should exclude delivery service data from the monitoring config snapshot that does not belong to the given cdn being snapshotted it currently includes all delivery services across all cdns
 tm should be updated to only overwrite the traffic monitor data in its monitoring config snapshot in the code linked above with crconfig data if the monitoring snapshot is still missing  and  data otherwise it should never have to overwrite the monitoring config data eventually we can remove that fallback code entirely once its assumed that tm config snapshots will always have ip data going forward

 traffic ops

 current behavior
currently its a string that represents an array of strings separated by commas eg usca

 new behavior
arrays should be arrays eg  if the parser is smart enough and if we care to do it this way that could be done in a backwardcompatible manner such that if the field is a string its parsed as a commadelimited array and if its an array its parsed as such with the right validation currently it has none but country codes cant for example legally contain commas the storage format could even be kept the same which not only obviates the need for a migration but trivializes supporting old api versions

309,ive noticed that many api endpoints support query parameters that are undocumented for example  mention that a possible parameter to pass to get   is tenant to filter by tenant but that endpoint actually supports other parameters like eg username to filter by a specific username those parameters ought to be documented,TD,TD
310," this improvement request usability performance tech debt etc affects these traffic control components
 traffic ops

 current behavior
if a user requests a password reset a login token is generated for them the token is never removed until the user actually changes his or her password but successfully authenticating with a token grants a valid mojolicious cookie which is refreshed on every subsequent successful request so users choose to take advantage of this token and never change their password so it sticks around for years this is dangerous for two reasons

 tokens are not encrypted at rest in the database unlike passwords yet they are as powerful as passwords so if a password needs to be encrypted at rest then so does a token imo
 unlike a password which is only ever presented by the client to the server a login token is sent out from the server over smtp as a part of a link in an email because the token is not singleuse and because the only way to remove it is by updating the users password this is exactly equivalent to sending the users unencrypted password via email which youd never do

 new behavior
tokens should be singleuse i know this feature is being used in productiontestingdevdemo environments eg cdninaboxs extension user but we now have oauth support in to as of a couple years ago if memory serves so if tokenbased authentication is desired it can still be done its possibly difficult to switch but i think its worth it

also most of the client methods return tcalerts rather than the corresponding nullable struct response for that endpoint which means that the full json response returned via the api is not decoded this means on a post or put request that the client is forced to make a followup get request in order the get the newly createdupdated resource which is very inefficient and also reduces our ability to test api responses in the go api integration tests

 documentation

 current behavior
with roles and permissions being implemented capabilities have no plans for future use so they should be deprecated in api versions earlier than  and removed from  and later since they are not enforced anywhere removing the endpoint from  wont break any permissions checking even though that version still supports the old privlevel method of permissions checking

if done before permissions are fully integrated into tp the tp services can just be downgraded to use the stable api in lieu of stripping the functionality out entirely were going to need to rework that for permissions soon anyway so theres no need to make bigger changes than are necessary


 new behavior
capabilities is deprecated in api 

",TD,TD
360,"the tr api has docs 

but theyre incomplete and not in a very visible place

we should add explanations and examples of what they return

we should also probably put the router api docs in a more visible place maybe create a unified root apis doc page with links to the apis of every component",TD,TD

 traffic ops

 current behavior
currently its a string that represents an array of strings separated by commas eg usca

 new behavior
arrays should be arrays eg  if the parser is smart enough and if we care to do it this way that could be done in a backwardcompatible manner such that if the field is a string its parsed as a commadelimited array and if its an array its parsed as such with the right validation currently it has none but country codes cant for example legally contain commas the storage format could even be kept the same which not only obviates the need for a migration but trivializes supporting old api versions

currently you can send a user registration in tp at  this requires an email role and tenant for the new user the result is a new user is created with

 usertenant  

and an email is sent to the user with a link to complete the registrationie change the username and specify a desired password note once the user is updated usernewuser is set to false the newuser flag is basically used to determine if registration is complete or not

however these registrations tend to never get completed maybe the email found its way into the users spam folder or something

 new behavior
on the user page ie 

 if usernewuser  true add a field to tp to display the userregistrationsent value
 if usernewuser  true add a button to resend registration which will send the existing email role and tenant to the post apiusersregister endpointwhich will resend the registration email and reset the registrationsent value

when the traffic ops api response to a request made by the go client is   and   the body of the response is read into the content of a returned error  and behind the scenes the body is also closed this makes it difficult to write client methods that actually return error alerts since the normally used methods employed by writers of a new client method will all exhibit this behavior

 current behavior

when you make a post request to regions endpoint in api  if you pass in the body with id from one division division  for eastern division and name from another division divisionname western you get a successful response 

 expected behavior

request with mismatch id and name would fail or divisionname could be dynamically named based on id i believe we do this already

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions

if the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and
include the applicable tc version

when assigning servers to a delivery service you typically use the search bar to narrow down your choices however with a high number of servers for instance  the search bar is not responsive to user input you type something into the bar then your input shows up a second later with the search results

 current behavior
get serversdsiddsid is returning mids that do not have the dss required server capabilities

 expected behavior
if a delivery service requires one or more server capabilities the results of get serversdsiddsid should never include cache servers edges or mids that do not have all of the dss required server capabilities org servers are different thanks to mso and are returned regardless

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
 create a ds that employs both the edge and mid tier ie a dns delivery service
 add a required server capability to the ds
 add the same server capability to a handful of edge servers ensure those edge servers are in a cache group that is parented by a mid cache group and assign those edges to the ds
 get serversdsiddsid and notice that mids are returned when mids were never assigned the server capability

 current behavior
when submitting a post request to deliveryservicerequests if the request bodys deliveryservice object has no tenantid property or probably also null but i havent checked the handler will return a  internal server error to the client

also the tenant id checked for user access is whatever the user submitted  not the actual tenant of the delivery service in this way a change or delete request can be submitted by a user who does not have permission to modify that delivery service so a user with a tenant id of  which is a child of tenant  can legally submit a request for any delivery service accessible to  by simply replacing the tentantid property of the deliveryservice object with their own tenants id

 expected  new behavior
if a property is required then omitting it should cause a  bad request response with an appropriate alerts entry describing the problem

a resources actual tenancy should be checked  returning a  forbidden response in the event that access is not allowed  instead of whatever the client asks to be checked

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
make a post request to deliveryservicerequests containing a syntactically valid dsr but one wherein the tenantid of the deliveryservice object is undefined

 current behavior
because of the way workflow transitions are verified creating a dsr with any nonnull value in the id property will cause the request to fail if id was an integer though it will give back the errorlevel alert sql no rows in result set which is both cryptic and  looking at the code  unnecessary

 expected  new behavior
if ids have special meaning to requests they should be documented  but its more likely that the intended behaviour is just to ignore the id since it cant reasonably be known before the object is created

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
submit a post request to deliveryservicerequests with an integral id value the simplest request body to reproduce the error is just id  which should work regardless of extant data

there is a python rewrite of the postinstall script  instead of relying on perl dependencies for the old postinstall script we should consider having cdn in a box use the python version of postinstall

  traffic monitor

 current behavior
traffic monitor indiscrimantly sums up bandwidth calculations from all reported interfaces whether the interface is marked as monitor this interface or not when more than  interface is returned for a cache server and it is assumed to be part of the calculations this results in inaccurate numbers as some interfaces are nested  children interfaces or loopback which result in  calculations at a minimum

 expected behavior
only the interfaces marked with monitor this interface should be included in the calculations

 current behavior

recently we issued a large scale invalidation request against one of our delivery services  unfortunately we didnt realize that the origin was not configured to handle ifmodifiedsince or ifnonematch headers and always sent back  instead of   this resulted in a storm of requests going to the origin and a new mini storm starting every time an edge cache ats was restarted

perhaps some message or some documentation should be added to ensure that whoever uses invalidations realizes that they are designed to be used with origins that properly handle ims requests

when you make a commit or create a pr github actions will run a set of tests on your code the golang unit tests task sometimes fails due to a couple of known culprits look here 
i havent been able to reproduce this locally but maybe if you run the test multiple times it will eventually fail because it seems like a race condition atm

 current behavior
if the releasepl script fails to edit the version file it will plow ahead anyway or presumably if any step fails it will continue to do things possibly incorrectly

 expected behavior
if part of the process of creating a release or candidate fails the script should exit immediately printing what went wrong ideally to stderr and use a nonzero exit code

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
i think if you try to create an existing release it wont have any negative side effects so checkout eg the  tag and do miscreleasepl gpgkeysome key  cut

 these numbers are populated from the api call


get 


therefore the labels online caches reported caches etc is misleading

 new behavior
labels should be
 online edge caches
 reported edge caches
 offline edge caches
 admin down edge caches

or an even better solution would be to aggregate the numbers for all caches edges and mids which would require either making a few calls like


get 
get 


and summing the results or making an api change to support something like


get 


which pulls numbers for any server of type edge or mid

the old perl api accepts both integers and strings since it is a dynamic language in most go endpoints only an integer is accepted

for instance the regions endpoint documentation says that the post supports strings 
but actually posting an integer string yields an error message 

the go endpoints should be able to accept either integer or string integers to reduce the likelihood of breaking things that were once supported

  traffic ops ort

 current behavior

observed in   built from 

for testing purposes i will remove trafficserver and trafficserverdebuginfo and blow away opttrafficserver then run ort badass as root
with trafficopsortpl sub directories in opttrafficserveretc such as ssl and dscp end up as rootroot permission set to   this is consistent and part of my clean install involves chowning these subdirs
i tested with  and it will create these same directories with permissions  but still rootroot which allows ats to start with no complaints

 expected  new behavior
likely these subdirs should be created as atsats so they can be picked up when ats starts
it might be that we want to keep the ssl directory as  owned by ats for security purposes but possibly keep others like dscp at

  traffic router

 current behavior

when running the traffic router tests in externaltestsuite steeringtest fails with


expected a value greater than 
     but  was equal to 
	at 


 expected behavior

the tests in steeringtest should pass

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions

if the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and
include the applicable tc version

run the external tests for convenience i have made a branch that runs steeringtest only in cdninabox


you can use it to run the traffic router tests including external tests as follows
shell
dockercompose up d
dockercompose f dockercomposereadinessyml up readiness  waits for traffic monitor to be usable by traffic routers
dockercompose f dockercomposetrafficroutertestyml up trintegrationtest

this section

steeringtest has failed since  and snuck into  the only  assertions that fail are 
java
		assertthatrehashedpathsgetsmallertargetsize greaterthanhashedpathsgetsmallertargetsize
		assertthatrehashedpathsgetlargertargetsize lessthanhashedpathsgetlargertargetsize


i think this is because steeringwatcher doesnt get to update 

the reason i dont think steeringwatcher updates after that point is that letsencryptdnschallengewatchers scheduledexecutorservice hangs when trying to update letsencryptdnschallengewatchers database 

for whatever reason fetchers request for letsencryptdnschallengewatcher never makes it to httpdataserver the mock to server even though the host and port seem to line up but if you make fetcher return for letsencryptdnschallengewatcher requests right before 
java
			if urlcontainsletsencrypt 
				return http
			


then steeringtest succeeds if you dont the request doesnt seem to ever complete



other notes
 changing defaultlednschallengeurl to  so it doesnt end in a slash then  does not keep letsencryptdnschallengewatchers fetcher request from hanging
 one abstractresourcewatcher hanging should not make another abstractresourcewatcher hang if traffic router does this outside of tests its a serious bug that we should fix

464,"currently if traffic router has a geo miss and then uses the delivery services miss location its logged as rtypegeo this makes it impossible to determine from the logs which ips were geo misses

the code looks like its here 

if clientlocation  null 
	clientlocation  dsgetmisslocation



id like to propose a new rtype log geods when a geo miss occurs 

i havent tested but i believe it may simply be a matter of adding tracksetresultresulttypegeods to the above if statement

this would allow operators to find geo misses in the logs

also note ds miss location may currently be broken due to a maxmind change to always return the center of the us on a miss the fix for that shouldnt conflict with this feature

 current behavior
making a put request to deliveryservicesidsafe will return a different structure from a request made to deliveryservices for the same api version as these are not the same endpoint theres technically no reason they need to return the same structural representation for the same delivery service at the same api version but based on the way the deliveryservicesidsafe endpoint is documented and my own strong desire to see the two endpoints use a consistent representation ive decided to label this a bug

the various api versions requested for deliveryservicesidsafe compared to the api version of deliveryservices that would yield the same structure as deliveryservicesidsafe are given below

deliveryservicesidsafe version  deliveryservices version

we should make the cache config generation for urlsig insert these necessary strings if they dont exist and log a warning

one ds should never be able to cause the cdn to fail or fail to load new config we could also remove the ds line from remapconfig but most users probably dont care about the parameters its easy enough to add them to make the ds succeed

 current behavior
tr will not load a snapshot that has an https delivery service with a missing cert therefore tr will be stuck with an old snapshot until the problem is resolved and a cert is created for the https ds or the https ds is switched to http

 expected behavior
prevent the creation of an invalid snapshot or handle invalid snapshots more gracefully 

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
 create a delivery service with protocolhttps do not add a cert to the delivery service
 snapshot the cdn for the delivery service
 tr will not reload the new snapshot due to the missing cert

 anything else
possible solutions
 when snapshotting a cdn via the api return  if any of the cdns https delivery services are missing a cert
 autogenerate a selfsigned cert when creating an https ds or updating an http ds to an https ds
 tr could somehow filter out the bad dss and consume the rest of the snapshot

  traffic ops

 current behavior
making a put request to serversiddeliveryservices will return a different structure from a request made to deliveryservices for the same api version as these are not the same endpoint theres technically no reason they need to return the same structural representation for the same delivery service at the same api version but because released api versions were retroactively changed to return extra fields this is a regression bug in fixing it i suggest we define the response structure to be isomorphic to deliveryservices

the various api versions requested for serversiddeliveryservices compared to the api version of deliveryservices that would yield the same structure as serversiddeliveryservices are given below

  traffic vault

 current behavior
when using the  feature of riak the user has to pass a maximum number of rows that can be turned in a single query this is 

the endpoints using this search query are
get cdnsnamenamesslkeys  gets all sslkeys for dss on a cdn
delete snapshot  deletes old sslkeys on a ds for a cdn

in effect this means that if you have a cdn with over  thousand dss with sslkeys the client will be unable to get all of the sslkeys
in terms of deleting if any change is made to a cdn with over  keys then only the first  sslkey records for that cdn will be correctly cleaned up




 expected behavior
cdn works as expected regardless of the number of sslkeys specifically get cdnsnamenamesslkeys should be able to return more than  records and delete snapshot should cleanup all sslkeys regardless of total count


 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
create a cdn with over a thousand ds that have sslkeys

making a put request to deliveryservicesidsafe will return a different structure from a request made to deliveryservices for the same api version as these are not the same endpoint theres technically no reason they need to return the same structural representation for the same delivery service at the same api version but because released api versions were retroactively changed to return extra fields this is a regression bug in fixing it i suggest we define the response structure to be isomorphic to deliveryservices

 current behavior
when using the  feature of riak the client has to pass a maximum number of rows that can be turned in a single query this is 

the endpoints using this search query are
get cdnsnamenamesslkeys  gets all sslkeys for dss on a cdn
put snapshot  deletes old sslkeys on a ds for a cdn

in effect this means that if you have a cdn with over  dss with sslkeys the client will be unable to get all of the sslkeys
in terms of deleting if any change is made to a cdn with over  keys then only the first  sslkey records for that cdn will be correctly cleaned up




 expected behavior
cdn works as expected regardless of the number of sslkeys specifically get cdnsnamenamesslkeys should be able to return more than  records and delete snapshot should cleanup all sslkeys regardless of total count

  traffic ops client go tests

 current behavior
the tests for the profileparameter endpoint methods of the client are checking that responses are by default sorted by parameter name which is impossible because the endpoint doesnt return parameter names  it succeeds only because a list of empty strings is trivially sorted both ascending and descending

the specific test content is
go
func sorttestprofileparameterst testingt 
	var header httpheader
	var sortedlist string
	resp  err  tosessiongetprofileparametersnil header
	if err  nil 
		tfatalfexpected no error but got v errerror
	
	for i  range resp 
		sortedlist  appendsortedlist respparameter
	

	res  sortsliceissortedsortedlist funcp q int bool 
		return sortedlist  sortedlist
	
	if res  true 
		terrorflist is not sorted by their names v sortedlist
	



now the endpoint does return objects with a parameter property but that is actually the parameters id not its name the objects returned from the client have their profilename and parameterid set but not lastupdated by a coercion process in the client itself that unmarshals the response as an array of profileparameternullable and then broadens the data to profileparameter which contains many extraneous fields

 expected behavior
tests should only test expected behavior and client methods should use appropriate data types in their call signatures

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
add a tlogf to that test to print out the list then run it and observe that the list contains only empty strings

 expected behavior
since all the caches are online the above example should have no cachegroups in disabledlocations when a cachegroup is in disabledlocations that essentially tells tr that all caches in that cachegroup are unavailable

 minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
set all caches to online in a cdn with one or more delivery services snapshot and request tms publishcrstates api

 anything else
ive tried to reproduce this in ciab but in ciab tm doesnt populate the disabledlocations array the same as it does in the environment in which this was observed honestly as this is basically just a premature optimization for traffic router we might just want to change tm to never populate the disabledlocations traffic router will still quickly find that all caches are unavailable in a given cachegroup and try the next closest checking disabledlocations probably only saves tr a handful of nanoseconds when routing a request and only if entire cachegroups are unavailable so i think wed be fine if tm never populated it

whats strange is that the client also has methods that utilize this parameter and request input as a string not an integral type and there are tests that are passing that use those methods

the profile structure in libgotc has a parameter field and the tests appear to be using this field to provide the input for the query parameter i can only assume that the tests are passing merely by virtue of the request returning a  ok response and that profileparameter property is always an empty string because it has no purpose or meaning and is never populated

 expected behavior
the client should test that query parameters behave in their intended way data structures should not have fields that serve no purpose requires  and passing a bad query parameter should result not in a  internal server error response but a  bad request response with an alert that explains why the request failed

while doing some testing this morning i notice that the max origin connection handling can produce some unexpected results for example we put a mid cache in admindown and the max connection goes up after a syncds the problem is that when you change a server back to reported those max connection dont get back to normal and requires a syncds to be triggered again

i wonder if it would be better to keep the max origin connection intact while a mid cache server is brought into admindown

this mostly doesnt affect anything but it keeps the max origin connection flipping up and down in the configuration

the admindown state is usually short lived 

proposal create a new  parameter to ignore max origin connection instead of changing to current behavior

 documentation

 current behavior
currently federations are among the most convoluted and difficult to comprehend conceptsobjects in traffic control the process to create a federation  and what one even does  is poorly understood by many and thats reflected by the fact that  thats  for posterity but latest has the same page at the time of this writing still has steps for and screenshots of the traffic ops ui that was removed years ago

part of this is undoubtedly caused by the myriad of api endpoints used to manipulate federations currently these exist

 cdnsnamefederations
 cdnsnamefederationsid
 federationsall
 federations
 federationsiddeliveryservices
 federationsiddeliveryservicesdsid
 federationresolvers
 federationsidfederationresolvers
 federationsidusers
 federationsidusersuserid

and i cant say with certainty whether anyone actually knows offhand what all of these do

this is related to  but that seems to be primarily concerned with adding a new feature for specifyingaddingupdating ranges of resolver ip addresses it could be done at the same time as this maybe even should be but doesnt represent the same concept as i understand it

 new behavior
ideally there would be exactly one endpoint to access federations federations im not sure that user assignmentassociation is still relevant since that was created in the days of delivery servicetouser assignmentsassociations which no longer exist if so though the federationsidusers endpoint and federationsidusersuserid may also need to exist separately in some form although that would depend on the design chosen

im not going to propose a design here since i am one of the many who does not understand federations or their usecases and daytoday maintenance concerns people who have been working with these systems  apparently without the need for a guide  should be consulted on what information constitutes a federation and how its used and a design can be drafted from there

when a delivery service uses a topology it still should have a total for all online and offline caches as well as totals for each cache group employed by the topology such as this


response 
totaloffline 
totalonline 
cachegroups 

offline 
online 
name usflsarasota


offline 
online

 steps to reproduce
 assign servers directly to a delivery service
 get apiversiondeliveryservicesidhealth and observe the onlineoffline counts total and per cache group
 assign a topology to the delivery service
 get apiversiondeliveryservicesidhealth and observe no onlineoffline counts total and per cache group

noneall depending on your point of view this bug only affects pkg

 current behavior
the pkg script when given no arguments will build every project listed by l

 expected behavior
previously the default build list was not the same as the output of l which just listed all projects that could be built in particular docs weasel and grovetccfgbuild used to be skipped when building without listing specific projects weasel takes a while so this does represent a significant increase in build time

however this behavior does seem more consistent i may even like it better than the old behavior but for convenience id want to at least be able to explicitly exclude projects from the build because i almost never want to build docs source grove both regular grove and grovetccfg or weasel

so in conclusion im not sure we want to consider this a regression bug or an intended feature change but the bottom line is that things that used to not happen are now happening so thats why its labeled like this feel free to change it

 steps to reproduce
run pkg from the repo root notice what it builds

 documentation

 current behavior
the docs say that theres a field containing the name of the users role called rolename


 expected behavior
the docs should accurately document the apis output


 steps to reproduce
toget kp   jq response  returns

note the field name is rolename not rolename

its unclear whether this is a regression without digging further into git history than i feel like doing right now but i think thats unlikely and its probably just that the docs have been copied with each successive major api version release from the previous version since  was added and the godoc for the field on the libgotc struct related to api user representations mentions a difference between api versions in the name of that property interestingly though the api docs for  get the name right while  and  both use the incorrect camelcase form

  traffic portal

 current behavior

recently we issued a large scale invalidation request against one of our delivery services  unfortunately we didnt realize that the origin was not configured to handle ifmodifiedsince or ifnonematch headers and always sent back  instead of   this resulted in a storm of requests going to the origin and a new mini storm starting every time an edge cache ats was restarted

perhaps some message or some documentation should be added to ensure that whoever uses invalidations realizes that they are designed to be used with origins that properly handle ims requests

 traffic control health client 

 current behavior

the tc health client uses tms apicachestatuses api for getting cache availability states in order to mark caches updown this is very dangerous because this api returns the tms local cache states rather than the combined cache states of itself and its peers using the optimistic health protocol using this api the tc health client will set caches down when only the single requested tm thinks theyre down however if that singular tm is on a network partition and cant reach those caches because of it it will mark those caches down even though they might be perfectly reachable by its peers and the broader client base

 expected behavior

the tc health client should use tms publishcrstates api for getting cache availability states this api returns the combined cache states of itself and its peers participating in the optimistic health protocol and this api is what traffic router actually uses for routing clients to available caches

in addition to the dangers of using tms local cache states apicachestatuses includes a lot of unnecessary data that the tchealthclient doesnt really need whereas publishcrstates is simply just cache availability we also shouldnt have traffic router and the tchealthclient using different apis for getting cache states from tm

 steps to reproduce
 if the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and
include the applicable tc version

disconnect a tm from the cache network or otherwise make it unable to reach one or more caches request apicachestatuses and publishcrstates and compare the results as long as a cache is reachable and otherwise healthy the other peers will consider it available so the caches will be available in publishcrstates but not in apicachestatuses",Not_TD,Not_TD

 traffic ops

 current behavior
the api does not require a latitude and longitude when creating a cache group omitting those properties or setting them to null explicitly in the post request to create a cache group does not result in an underlying coordinate being created for the cache group a further put request to change eg the name of the cache group will cause a segmentation fault as traffic ops tries to dereference the null id of the coordinate associated with the cache group during the update process the request then fails even if otherwise wellformed with a  internal server error response

 expected behavior
if coordinates are to be required in requests then omitting them or setting them to null in requests should return a client error code and an appropriate alert if coordinates are not intended to be required then the handler for put requests should not assume they exist and appropriately handle the case that they dont

 traffic portal

 current behavior
when a new user is registered traffic portal doesnt indicate that the password for that user must be set  which is actually true because traffic ops doesnt require it either so the form can be submitted without setting a password and that makes the token get dropped from the database leaving the user with no way to authenticate and since users cant be deleted and their emails must be unique thats not fixable without either direct database manipulation to be able to resend registration or some other user setting that users password as admins are allowed to do also their cookie is immediately invalid so that the very next request  and theres no way to obtain a new cookie

 expected behavior
local users must have either a token or a password because they need to be able to log in the problem is that oauth and ldap users cant have a local password or rather ldap users cant and oauth users need not solving this problem will therefore necessitate finding a different way to tell how a user is supposed to authenticate which will involve database and api changes and putting a way to select how the user will authenticate in the user registration form

 register a user
 go to the link in the email
 set the full name as indicated by the form as being required then submit the form
 if you just wait like a minute a newcount logs request will be made that will cause a user not found error to be returned from the api and youll be dropped back on the login page with no way to log in since you dont have a password",Not_TD,Not_TD

 traffic monitor

 current behavior
as of  tm will no longer overwrite its monitoringjson snapshot data with corresponding crconfig snapshot data if the monitoringjson contains ip addresses for the tms meaning it now has parity with the crconfig data however it still needs the crconfig in order to filter out delivery services from monitoringjson which arent present in the crconfig that was fixed in  in that the monitoringjson no longer contains delivery services from other cdns to which the tm doesnt belong

 new behavior
once atc  is released with the changes from  we should be able to remove this fallback behavior from tm and possibly its reliance on the crconfig altogether in the next majorminor release that is because monitoringjson snapshots as of to  will contain all the necessary data and will no longer need to rely on the crconfig snapshot

 traffic router

 current behavior

the current  config causes tr to rename accesslog to  for example then recreate the accesslog file this can cause data loss problems for log forwarding tools that expect to tail the same log file without having it change out from underneath them

 new behavior

trs  config should use a rollover strategy that doesnt cause the log file to be renamed then recreated i think this can be accomplished with a directwriterolloverstrategy which is documented  however in order to limit the number of rolledover log files on disk we may need to combine that with a custom delete action which is documented

 traffic monitor

 description
currently the tchealthclient is using the traffic monitor apicachestatuses endpoint to find and mark down unhealthy parents  this endpoint it turns out is for local tm state and may not reflect the state as reached by consensus of all tms  the healthclient is being switched to use the publishcrstates endpoint instead

however the publishcrstates endpoint lacks the status field that is available in the apicachestatuses endpoint  this field was logged by the healthclient so that it may be understood why the parent was marked down ie the health threshold that triggered the markdown  it would be invaluable to continue this logging if the field could be added to the publishcrstates endpoint or a query parameter that would let the client ask for the field as part of the response  querying both endpoints is not desirable

also a date time field should be added to the publishcrstates endpoint response that shows when the health monitor last polled the cache  this could also be added to the response only when requested with a query parameter

example status information from apicachestatuses

 reported  availablebandwidthinkbps too low

 reported  querytime too high

 automation ansible 

 current behavior

the ldapconf file is rendered based on the template and ldap variables when the trafficops role is run the toldapsetup boolean variable is not used to determine if the config file should be rendered or not  it seems that traffic ops golang   and maybe older versions  will read the ldapconf file regardless of if the ldapconf path is defined in cdnconf for perl backwards compatibility 

when running the playbook without defining any of the ldap variables  eg toldaphostname  i end up with a ldapconf file like this


cat opttrafficopsappconfldapconf

   adminpass  
   searchbase  
   admindn  
   host  
   searchquery  
   insecure  



because that file is in the default conf directory traffic ops golang will read it on service start this gives the following error

mar    trafficops loading config parsing ldap conf  json cannot unmarshal number into go struct field configldapinsecure of type bool

im unsure what the array of numbers means in the error message

when i alter the toldapinsecure in infrastructureansiblerolestrafficopsdefaultsmainyml to be a bool instead of a number the error changes to

mar    trafficops loading config ldap conf missing adminpass field

in both situtations the daemon does not start

i think the ldapconf file should not be rendered in all situation by infrastructureansiblerolestrafficopstaskstrafficopsyml and a conditional should be used instead

the trafficops role when using default ldap config should allow the daemon to start

dont set any ldap variables so the defaults are used and then run the trafficops playbook

 traffic control cache config  formerly ort

when running  apply in badass mode on a new edge system we are seeing errors regarding the creation of directories required for config files  ssl files for example


error   unable to create the directory opttrafficserveretctrafficserverdscp for 
error   unable to create the directory opttrafficserveretctrafficserverssl for 


the transfer of the config files mentioned above was aborted so we ended up with an invalid traffic server config directory  an ssl key file mentioned in sslmulticertconfig that was not on the system 

the directory in both cases above were created correctly and any subsequent config files placed into those folders worked as expected

running the  apply with the same args a second time corrected the issue copied the missing files and gave us a valid trafficserver config directory

looking at the code it appears the domkdirwithowner function will not return true even if the directory creation worked correctly





 expected behavior

traffic server config should be valid after the  apply run has completed

 steps to reproduce

a cache config in traffic ops  that includes ssl certs  being applied to a freshly installed cache server should reproduce this issue on the first runs of  apply

 traffic ops

 current behavior
usercurrent validates the role field and will reject requests that specify a new role with greater permissions or in old version privlevel than the users current role  but even if that validation passes its not possible to use this endpoint to change role the request will succeed but even in the response to that request the users role remains unchanged

usercurrent get requests also always show gid and uid as null even when they arent curiously it does allow the user to change these fields and the responses to put requests that do so will show the correct values subsequent get requests will show null

 expected behavior
usercurrent shouldnt show the wrong value for fields and if its intended to be able to change a users role using it then that should work if thats not intended then the field should be ignored not validated and removed from the request documentation

 steps to reproduce
put to usercurrent changing your role to anything you have permission to change it to observe that it didnt happen

put to usercurrent changing your uid and gid to anything nonnull observe that both still appear to be null in get responses

it is unknown if this is a regression or if this has just been broken forever since uid and gid have no known use and changing a users own role is rare and generally not very advisable because they can only be taking permissions away from themselves  so its possible this never worked and nobody noticed because nobody needed it to work

 traffic ops


 current behavior

when making a get request  where id belongs to a profile that is not index  in the profilenames array the response will not display that server

for example if there exists a server with the profilenames
json


 profilenames 
                edgetieratscache midtieratscache
            




where the id of the edgetieratscache profile is  and the id of midtieratscache is 

if we perform a get request   we will see the server above returned in the response however
if we perform a get request   the following profile  at index  in the array that server will not be included in the response 


 expected behavior


should account for all profiles including profiles not at index  in the profilenames array

 steps to reproduce
 if the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and
include the applicable tc version

have a server with multiple profiles make a get request  where id belongs to the profile not at index  you will not see the server included in the response

 traffic ops

 current behavior
the fields email and fullname are not allowed to be blank missing or null in put or post requests to usersid and users respectively but are allowed to be any of those things in put requests to usercurrent so you can put your user in a state where it cant be updated via put usersid without fixing preexisting issues which could cause problems in a situation where there isnt a human around to intervene

also a put request to usercurrent because it incorrectly behaves more like a patch doesnt require other fields  role id username and tenantidtenantid whereas users does thats not as big a deal though because it leaves them unchanged when not specified

 expected behavior
our users api should make sense

 steps to reproduce
edit yourself to have a null fullname then try to update your  using a put request to users",Not_TD,TD
596," this bug report affects these traffic control components
 traffic ops

 current behavior
usercurrent validates the role field and will reject requests that specify a new role with greater permissions or in old version privlevel than the users current role  but even if that validation passes its not possible to use this endpoint to change role the request will succeed but even in the response to that request the users role remains unchanged

usercurrent get requests also always show gid and uid as null even when they arent curiously it does allow the user to change these fields and the responses to put requests that do so will show the correct values subsequent get requests will show null

 expected behavior
usercurrent shouldnt show the wrong value for fields and if its intended to be able to change a users role using it then that should work if thats not intended then the field should be ignored not validated and removed from the request documentation

 steps to reproduce
put to usercurrent changing your role to anything you have permission to change it to observe that it didnt happen

put to usercurrent changing your uid and gid to anything nonnull observe that both still appear to be null in get responses

it is unknown if this is a regression or if this has just been broken forever since uid and gid have no known use and changing a users own role is rare and generally not very advisable because they can only be taking permissions away from themselves  so its possible this never worked and nobody noticed because nobody needed it to work

 current behavior
the representations of users are different depending on the api endpoint used to view them eg usercurrent uses the field rolename to hold the name of the users role while users shows the same information in the rolename property

the current model for users api   makes some structural changes in some contexts is such that requests and responses have different shapes depending on the request method  and some fields are even renamed between requests and responses

 requests use tenantid responses have tenantid
 responses from post requests and put requests where the password was changed include confirmlocalpasswd but get representations never do
 post and put responses dont include registrationsent but get requests always do
 users never shows localuser but usercurrent always does
 post and put requests allow newuser to be null but thats actually not allowed in the database and get requests will always show an actual boolean value plus if newuser was null in a post or put to users it will be null in the response but if it was null in a put to usercurrent the response will properly show false like a subsequent get
 put to usercurrent doesnt require any fields not even those required by post and put requests to users making it nonidempotent in violation of the http spec
 put to usercurrent literally doesnt work at all see  

and then of course we have the pervasive issue where things are allowed to be missing from the request as a synonym for null but thats more an issue just because in tsjs undefined and null are different but go makes no such distinction without jumping through some encodingjsonrawmessage hoops

 new behavior
users should be represented consistently in a single way throughout the api

 traffic ops

 current behavior


this is a very specific scenario currently it works as such

there must exist an active mso delivery service with an origin server assigned must have the status online or reported
if you update the status of the origin to admindown this should result in a  making sure all the other fields are the exact same

http
  conflict
contenttype applicationjson
transferencoding chunked

    alerts 
        
            text setting server status to admindown would leave active delivery service  with no online or reported org servers
            level error
        
    



however if you change the profilenames replacing the previous profile to another you will get the same result but that server will no longer exist in any get requests however the server is still in the db

this only happens if you remove the previous profilename adding additional profiles will not create this issue 

the only get request that still shows that the previous servers exist is

server should be appearing in any and all valid get requests

 traffic control cache config  formerly ort
 traffic ops
 traffic portal

 current behavior

currently we can set a max origin value on a per ds basis this then gets spread across the last tier of all caches assigned to a delivery service however this currently does not work in instances where we are using topologies but have a localized origin ie say you have multiple services each covering a different region of the us but are using a topology that is just allonetier so that you can have failover this calculation for max origin will then include every server on that topology instead of just ones localized to a cache group for that region drastically reducing the max origin count

 new behavior

i suggest adding some sort of toggle on a ds with the max origins to indicate that the origin server is localized for one specific area then we would also need  changes to understand that toggle and know to calculate the max origin based on cache group instead of topology wide
