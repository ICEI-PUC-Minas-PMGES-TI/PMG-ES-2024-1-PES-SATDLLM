currently passgenerator is not deterministic because the optimization it uses occurs in a seperate thread this is bydesign so that it is performant in game scenarios but it means that tests for it are quite flaky we should redesign it to separate out the threading if possible or at least add a compiler flag to disable it and add a way to run it for a set number of iterations for the testing purposes

set robot a at 
set ball at 
run tactic grabball 
assert robot moves to ball

and similarly for plays

some general notes from brainstorming
 do not simulate collisions physics just step robots along the direction of their path  primitive
 do not simulate ball motion initially
 start with a basic one where we have simulated implementations for how the primitives move
 move to using our firmware stack later

now that we better understand our use cases for avoidareas how we use them and how we think we want to control them we should rethink the idea in general they work well and the idea of discrete areas to avoid on the field makes sense but how they were set and communicated between the strategy and the navigator got too complicated

we should figure out how we want to solve this new datastructures new concept entirely

one suggestion was to replace the avoidarea enums with classes and inheritance a class for each discrete type of area
 abstract avoidarea class and concrete implementation of each type like area around ball
 the classes could then provide getavoidarea or getshape function that can be consumed by the navigator generically
 the classes could also be constructed with parameters if tactics or actions need more direct control

we would like to be able to control a single robot using an xbox controller this is very useful for demos and sometimes testing its also fun

we would like to implement xbox control with our new software system this will require
 finding a library to read xbox controll input over usb
 creating an executable that will transform the xbox controller data into primitives that will be sent to the robot the backend can handle the sending the primitives the xbox module just needs to handle translating input into primitives
 we have a directvelocity primitive that can be used for this as its easy to map a joystick direction to a velocity vector

a basic gtest for integration tests should be set up demonstrating how the system will be brought up for each test a simulatorbackend aiwrapper and optionally visualizerwrapper will need to be created and connected for each separate test

the simulatorbackend should expose basic controls for stepping the simulation forward since we want to synchronize the simulation with the ai in order for the tests to be deterministic ie the simulation should step forwards a set amount in time for every time the ai makes a decision if we were to run at max speed the simulation would get way ahead of the ai which would get relatively little data which is not realistic

now that we better understand our use cases for avoidareas how we use them and how we think we want to control them we should rethink the idea in general they work well and the idea of discrete areas to avoid on the field makes sense but how they were set and communicated between the strategy and the navigator got too complicated

we should figure out how we want to solve this new datastructures new concept entirely

one suggestion was to replace the avoidarea enums with classes and inheritance a class for each discrete type of area
 abstract avoidarea class and concrete implementation of each type like area around ball
 the classes could then provide getavoidarea or getshape function that can be consumed by the navigator generically
 the classes could also be constructed with parameters if tactics or actions need more direct control

before reading this please go read the implementation of findopencircles in geomutilscpp

currently in findopencircles we just add the  corners of rectangle given to the voronoi diagram and then find the largest open circle this is incorrect consider the case where the rectangle is the field and the points are enemy robots adding the corner points to the voronoi diagram is like treating every corner as an enemy robot instead of doing this we should just construct the voronoi diagram from the given points then treat all intersections of the voronoi diagram with the edge of the rectangle as vertices see this stackoverflow post



having a math background would be helpful for this

we want to add getenemyhalf and getfriendlyhalf functions to the field class since we use those areas of the field several times in our code but have to construct them manually having proper functions would make the code more clear

these functions should return rectangle objects for each half of the field respectively the enemy half is the positive x half and the friendly half is the negative x half

this ticket also involves using these new functions in places where we do the same calculations manually these new functions can be used in
 the indirectfreekickplay
 likely the shootorchip  shootorpass plays
 any play that uses cherry pickers
you might need to look around the plays since this is not an exhaustive list

this is kind of a bug when we tell robots to avoid a certain half of the field for example during penalty kicks sometimes the robots can move to the sides of the field and scoot up the sidelines this is because the rectangles representing the avoidareas for the friendly and enemy halfs of the field dont extend infinitely so the robots find the quickest way out which is out the side

ideally using these avoidareas should mean the robots cant be on that half at all ie if we enable avoidareaenemyhalf then robots shouldnt be allowed anywhere the x coordinate   similar for the friendly half but  

how to achieve this is up to the implementor but you proably want to talk with one of more of  jonathanlew mathewmacdougall

 adds nicer separation between a ballstate at a single point in time and a ball which stores history of multiple states currently this history is returned with the oldest data first and the newest data last

this is not consistent with how the data is stored internally to the ball newest data at the front  first furthermore most callers only need history starting from the latest data so returning the data with the newest first is easier to work with for example a caller doesnt need data in the range 

the ball history should changed to return the data with the newest data first and oldest data last other code that uses the history may need to be updated

some notes from preyear planning

more print operators for geometry shapes
clean up polygon
enforce that polygon is not crossed over itself in constructor
maybe not an issues if we use boost
make rectangle and triangle subclass polygon
look into replacing all geometry functions with boost implementations
can we just typedef our types
separate angle and angularvelocity classes
separate point and vector classes
maybe generic shape class

currently if we want the string representation for an enum we currently just define a lookup table from the enum name to the string see below for example this is problematic for several reasons
a its extra work  overhead to manage when the enum is changed ensuring the table is updated and tested etc etc
b its errorprone easy to forget to add an entry to the table or copypasta an entry and forget to change the actual string

we should have some way of defining an enum alongside its string representation that we can use anywhere in the repository one possible good option could be  or if we want to use an external library then the first answer on 

 its probably worth having a discussion about where this should go so talk to  or mathewmacdougall when you start this

the simulator and simulated tests need ways of validating behaviour because this behaviour occurs over time and include several distinct stages this requires something more complicated than simple googletest asserts

because each robot may be doing something independent there will be separate validation for each robot as well as global validation this will be accomplished by validation functions name tbd

validationfunctions will be lambda functions that accept a pointer to the world and a coroutine the reason the validation functions will be written with coroutines is because these functions will generally be checking for stages in behaviour like how tactics and plays are written so coroutines make that much easier to write

the validationfunctions may look something like this 

using validationcoroutine  
using validationfunction  stdfunction


the coroutine for the validation function will return an optional string which will allow the function to report and errors if they are encountered these error strings can then be propagated back to the simulatorbackend or test itself to be reported by googletest so failures show up nicely when the test is run

the simulatorbackend will accept a list of these validationfunctions when the simulation is started and run each function after every simulation step we will recommend that every robot has its own validation function and that a global validation function is also provided to make more generic assertions like no robots collided

the benefits of these perrobot functions is that we can reuse them once we write them for a given role for example once we write a validationfunction for a goalie eg robot never leaves the defense area and the ball never enters the net we can reuse it when testing other plays since all plays have a goalie this promotes lots of code reuse and should make writing tests for new plays much easier

finally since validationfunctions have a pointer to the world they can also make changes to the world state this is useful if for example we wanted the worlds gamestate to change once a robot got close to the ball during kickoff with coroutines in the validationfunctions we can easily wait until that condition  is met and then change the gamestate before moving on to the next stage

provide a way to initialize parameters instead of relying on static initialization

    define the task in one sentence
    if you cannot write the task in a sentence perhaps the task is too large
    and you should divide it down further


 outline the task in more detail
since we just use namespaces and dont have a singleton or class structure and because c doesnt guarantee any order of initialization there is no guarantee parameters will be ready when other constructorsobjects need them at the very beginning of the program

so in the functions value and setvalue we should only be returning the value of the parameter in the registry not the value of the parameter instance used to access the registry we currently do so so if any objects are initialized before the parameters are initialized we return t as there is nothing in the registry during this time

the simulator and simulated tests need ways of validating behaviour because this behaviour occurs over time and include several distinct stages this requires something more complicated than simple googletest asserts

because each robot may be doing something independent there will be separate validation for each robot as well as global validation this will be accomplished by validation functions name tbd

validationfunctions will be lambda functions that accept a pointer to the world and a coroutine the reason the validation functions will be written with coroutines is because these functions will generally be checking for stages in behaviour like how tactics and plays are written so coroutines make that much easier to write

the validationfunctions may look something like this 

using validationcoroutine  
using validationfunction  stdfunction


the coroutine for the validation function will return an optional string which will allow the function to report and errors if they are encountered these error strings can then be propagated back to the simulatorbackend or test itself to be reported by googletest so failures show up nicely when the test is run

the simulatorbackend will accept a list of these validationfunctions when the simulation is started and run each function after every simulation step we will recommend that every robot has its own validation function and that a global validation function is also provided to make more generic assertions like no robots collided

the benefits of these perrobot functions is that we can reuse them once we write them for a given role for example once we write a validationfunction for a goalie eg robot never leaves the defense area and the ball never enters the net we can reuse it when testing other plays since all plays have a goalie this promotes lots of code reuse and should make writing tests for new plays much easier

finally since validationfunctions have a pointer to the world they can also make changes to the world state this is useful if for example we wanted the worlds gamestate to change once a robot got close to the ball during kickoff with coroutines in the validationfunctions we can easily wait until that condition  is met and then change the gamestate before moving on to the next stage

create a ballstate class to store all existing ball state at a single point in time and have the ball class store a buffer of ballstate in order to preserver history

currently we store the history of the ball state by maintaining a buffer of previous positions velocities timestamps etc maintaining a buffer for each member variable is cumbersome and opens us up for mistakes since we dont have guarantees that the buffers will all be the same length so for example you cant loop over one buffer and access data in another buffer at the same index because one might be longer than the other

therefore we think its better to separate the state of the ball and the class that stores state

a new ballstate class should be created that represents a balls state at a single point in time  aka a single timestamp this new class will not have any buffers but will still have the same member variables like position velocity timestamp

the current ball class should then store a single buffer of ballstates in order to store history the ball class should still expose the same interface for getting the current data eg ballposition ballvelocity should still exist

the only function related to the balls state history should be getballstatehistory which returns the values in the buffer

there should be very few places if any that currently use the balls getpreviouspositions functions this should make changing the classes relatively safe since they expose the same interface

tests will need to be updated most existing ball tests would just become ballstate tests now the new ball class would need tests to make sure it returns the correct position velocity values ie making sure were returning from the right end of the buffer and that the history it returns is expected

 we should logically separate reading raw vision data from filtering
 filtering should also read radio breakbeam data more generally any data from the robots to help know where the ball is
 removing expired ball and team data should be done regardless of cameras being enabled  zones being disabled so we remove things properly and keep updating if we disable a camera 
 general idea here is we need to have a separate layer to integrate data from both the robots and network

this is only creating the new layer not adding any new algorithms things like the ball and robot filters should just need to be moved and shouldnt need to be changed

the data being passed from the backend to the sensorfusion to be our simple structs of balldetection robotdetection refboxdata etc

currently tactics return intents by calling actions however this can make it hard to test tactics because you have to understand the behavior of the action the tactic is using in order to figure out what intent should be returned as such we should consider having tactics return actions which can then be queried to get the next intent

this has some issues
 actions are stateful and use coroutines so cant be copied easily while running
 do you really need to understand actions to have an expected output from tactics

curently firmware structs like firmwarerobott dont take ownership of objects passed into them like chickert this means that the simulator would need to track these pointers as well to eventually free them

we are thinking of changing the firmware to take ownership and handle deallocation itself the simulator should either be changed in the meantime or we can wait for firmware if its done soon

currently we have no way of testing the high level behavior of tacticsplays we would like to have a very simple framework for specifying things like

set robot a at 
set ball at 
run tactic grabball 
assert robot moves to ball

and similarly for plays

some general notes from brainstorming
 do not simulate collisions physics just step robots along the direction of their path  primitive
 do not simulate ball motion initially
 start with a basic one where we have simulated implementations for how the primitives move
 move to using our firmware stack later
 should work with the visualizer
 should be able to run on ci
 should be fast to run

this ticket is for planning of work and creation of all the issues to make this happen

updated specification
after some consideration a test framework without physics isnt worth the effort of development because it doesnt cover most of the behavior we actually want to test for example intercepting a ball taking a shot dribbling behavior

as such we will be implementing a simple physics simulator in order to achieve the level of testing we want

highlevel specification
 will simulate physics like collisions and ball motion but will do so with extremely simple  no friction models so everything moves ideally
 should allow for firmware primitives to be simulated as well including our firmware motion control
 should be able to run at least as fast as real time
 should work with the visualizer
 should be able to run on ci without the visualizer

tickets for 
the first implementation of the simulator will be able to run basic tests as gtests with the option of displaying in the visualizer

   set up highlevel structure
   decide on physics engine
    implement and test simple physicsball
    implement and test simple physicsfield
    implement and test simple physicsrobot
  todo implement and test simple physicsteam
   implement and test simple physicsworld

we dont want to publish a world to our system if it has an invalid field because this can cause geometry issues and doesnt make sense to work with anyway likewise we make a very strong assumption that a ball always exists on the field so if our filters cant find the ball we should also not publish the world or find a different alternative behavior

reason as we integrate more robot sensor data into the robot class theres an emerging gap between the information a friendly robot can provide compared to an enemy robot for example break beam information would only be acquired from a friendly robot
goals
 create a robot class then create friendlyrobot and enemyrobot classes that inherit from it integrate it where there is a distinction on what type of robot is being created decide whether we need to have a neutral nonvirtual robot class or if we easily use a virtual robot class
 friendly robots must also support multiple versions as different versions have different attributes so this issue should also create a framework for that

we would like to be able to control a single robot using an xbox controller this is very useful for demos and sometimes testing its also fun

we would like to implement xbox control with our new software system this will require
 finding a library to read xbox controll input over usb
 creating an executable that will transform the xbox controller data into primitives that will be sent to the robot the backend can handle the sending the primitives the xbox module just needs to handle translating input into primitives
 we have a directvelocity primitive that can be used for this as its easy to map a joystick direction to a velocity vector

see  for the previous xbox code that translated the xbox commands into primitives

from an offline discussion about changes to the dynamicparameter system we came up with some new features wed like in the makeenum macro
 confirm if it works with manually specified enum values or not ie assigning an enum value to a specific number
 get the number of enum values more accurately
     methods like including a count value at the end can still be thrown off
 if possible make it easy to get a list of all enum values for a particular enum
 maintain the ability to get the string representation of an enum

in order to support enums directly in the new dynamicparameter system we need to know what header the enum is defined in so it can be included in the autogenerated code

one way of solving this is using export in the build file with the desired header and then depending on it as data however imo export is not very clear about ifwhere the file is being used and in the context of the module itself it doesnt make sense for random header files to be exported

another option is to create a custom bazel rule that given dependency targets can output the header files that are part of that target this can then be consumed as data by the main scripts we will need to see if the complexity of a custom rule is worth it but this should be a bit more clear than exporting files

currently the backend folder is split between input and output with the idea that input is data coming into the software stack and output is the data thats sent out from the software stack this is not actually the case however with radiooutput also serving the role of receiving data from the robots 

some ideas include
 separating out input from radiooutput
 restructuring input output folders in backend to some other division such as ssl msgs vs robot communication

some thoughts
 the protomulticastlistener can listen to tbotsrobotmsgs so that can all fit in the input folder
 mrf cant be neatly separated on an inputoutput basis since the annunciator receives robot msgs so its an input is a part of radiooutpu

current state obstacles are created from motion constraints using specific points from field and expanding using rectangleexpand this isnt ideal because some motion constraints should be implemented as being infinite in y axis  and we can also use rectangles already implemented in the field class such as getfriendlydefensearea

 improve readability of creating obstacles from motion constraints
 replace or wrap rectangleexpand where a specialized function would be more appropriate and easier to use
 improve navigation by implementing accurate representations of obstacles

create inflated and deflated defense area functions to replace some uses of rectangleexpand 
when we expandshrink a defense area using rectangleexpand were also moving the goal line since expand is wr to the centre point which can cause unexpected behaviour another problem is that different places inflate the defense area different amounts when it can probably be standardized

we need to implement a done condition for kicking and chipping actionstactics as discussed in  

we have implemented an approximation of this in the passertactic once it is trying to pass it continues to do so until
 the balls orientation of the balls velocity vector is nearly the same as the passing robot
 the magnitude of the balls velocity is above some threshold

a software approximation is the best we can do for now as we dont have access to extra firmware information yet like how long since we the kicker was fired

we should be able to break this out into its own function that can replace the implementation in the passertactic that we can then use for

code in the physics layer of the simulation code currently uses the world class to do a lot of setup as well as the main structure to return data

eg 

class physicsworld 
	explicit physicsworldworld world
	world getworld



this is not a good interface because the physics world only deals with physical objects but the world contains other higherlevel datastructures like the gamestate and gamecontroller information

to make the interfaces and implementation cleaner we should only use the more granular datastructures that matter for physics like field and ball we can provide more sane defaults and setters and getters

some context a parameter is a variable that we change dynamically during runtime through the visualizer a config is a collection of parameters or other configs configs can be nested for example you can have an aiconfig with a passingconfig and a defenseconfig those nested configs can hold other configs or parameters see this doc for more details some things have changed since but the gist of it is still captured


the idea behind  is to inject dependencies into classes when they need them rather than having them access state globally see here for more info on dependency injection 

previously we had all our parameter statically defined in namespaces for example 
c
namespace utildynamicparameters 
    refboxconfig 
        parameter overriderefboxdefendingsideparamname 
        
    
 



the problem with what we had before is that we had no control over accessingmutating parameters for example in goalietacticcpp you could access utildynamicparametersrefboxconfigoverridedefendingsidevalue and do some funky stuff also plays and tactics could mutate parameters we had no way of having const correctness until now

so now in  each config is a class and each parameter or nested config is a member of that class  see generateparameterspy and configutilshpp for more info so the above example now looks like this is networkinputcpp in the new system

c
   todo remove as part of 
  utildynamicparametersgetaiconfig
                getrefboxconfig
                overriderefboxdefendingside
                value



this still doesnt solve the previously mentioned problem as we are still accessing parameters globally this is where this ticket comes in with dependency injection the class using these parameters in networkinputcpp should get a sharedptr to refboxconfig in its constructor and only access those parameters this will facilitate testing and make it super explicit as to what parameters are being used in that class additionally using constpointercast we are able to enforce that no play or tactic can ever call a getmutable accessor and change the values

  inject those dependencies into plays tactics and anything else that uses dynamicparameters
  ensure const correctness make sure that all playstactics get immutable configs using constpointercast and the visualizer gets a regular shared ptr where it can use the getmutable accessors

a core component of our soontobe simulated testing system is the ability to validate what the robots and ai do 

 added validation functions which are the functions we use to validate behavior in simulated tests at a highlevel there are two types
 timeinvariant conditions
 timevariant conditions

this ticket will focus on writing timeinvariant validation functions for any ssl rules that apply

these validation functions will be used in our larger simulated testing framework  example of its usage can be found in srcsoftwaresimulatedtests

 action items 
 read the 
 create a list of rules that we can implement as timeinvariant validation functions
 check the list with mathewmacdougall or post in slack for more public discussion
 once each rule is okd add it as an acceptance criteria below this ticket will be used to track all rules we are adding rather than making a ticket for each
 for each rule
     implement it
     test it if necessary some will be simple enough they dont need additional tests others may be complicated enough they will use your best judgement

we dont want to publish a world to our system if it has an invalid field because this can cause geometry issues and doesnt make sense to work with anyway likewise we make a very strong assumption that a ball always exists on the field so if our filters cant find the ball we should also not publish the world or find a different alternative behavior

 added the isvalid function to field to check for zerolength fields because we did not want to publish worlds without a valid field

 then removed the default constructor from field because there were several instances where we were just manually default constructing fields with all zeroes

what this has led to is the easy ability to create degenerate fields that cause later problems for consumers its an antipattern to allow invalid filds to be created and provide an isvalid function that we trust people to check before doing anything with a field

to remedy this we should
 delete the default constructor for field
 remove the isvalid function
 throw an exception if a field is created with any zerolength parameters

any code that was defaultconstructing fields unnecessarily is likely a smell that something is being given more data than it needs eg being given the world when all it needs is the ball  robots

once  is implemented the simulator class will handle less of its own timing and provide an interface thats easier to work with

some previous problems weve had with the simulated tests are that if things run slowly or someone is debugging and stops at a breakpoint the threadedobservers will time out because they rely on wallclock timeouts

we can change the simulatedtestfixture to handle connecting the components itself without the threaded observers it can connect the simulatorbackend to the ai to worldstatevalidator and back to the backend in a singlethreaded loop that way we still get determinism but have less timingrelated issues this will also let the tests shut down sooner on failure since again they dont have to wait for a timeout

 added the isvalid function to field to check for zerolength fields because we did not want to publish worlds without a valid field

 then removed the default constructor from field because there were several instances where we were just manually default constructing fields with all zeroes

what this has led to is the easy ability to create degenerate fields that cause later problems for consumers its an antipattern to allow invalid filds to be created and provide an isvalid function that we trust people to check before doing anything with a field

to remedy this we should
 delete the default constructor for field
 remove the isvalid function
 throw an exception if a field is created with any zerolength parameters

any code that was defaultconstructing fields unnecessarily is likely a smell that something is being given more data than it needs eg being given the world when all it needs is the ball  robots

this is kind of a bug when we tell robots to avoid a certain half of the field for example during penalty kicks sometimes the robots can move to the sides of the field and scoot up the sidelines this is because the rectangles representing the motionconstraints for the friendly and enemy halfs of the field dont extend infinitely so the robots find the quickest way out which is out the side

ideally using these motionconstraints should mean the robots cant be on that half at all ie if we enable motionconstraintenemyhalf then robots shouldnt be allowed anywhere the x coordinate   similar for the friendly half but  

how to achieve this is up to the implementor but you proably want to talk with one of more of  jonathanlew mathewmacdougall 

once this is done the motionconstraintfriendlyhalf whitelist can be removed from penaltykickplaycpp and the motionconstraintenemyhalf whitelist can be removed from penaltykickenemyplaycpp

the current interface of the simulator class is for interacting only with teams in terms of friendly and enemy this needs to be updated to support arbitrary yellow and blue teams

in addition the simulator will now be less responsible for timing this will be moved to a new threadedsimulator or the simulatedtestfixture as needed
 simulator will only have runforduration and getworld nothing more for timing related code
 for now the output of the simulator will still be out internal datatypes we will change to proto in a separate issue

for context calculatetransitionspeedbetweensegments in navigatornavigatorcpp is used to slow down the robot depending on how dramatically the direction changes from one segment to the next evanmorcom pointed out that the project used could return a negative value which we would then take the length of if a path doubled back on itself in the case of two segments that go in opposite directions we would want the final speed at the end of the first segment to be zero to facilitate changing directions the length of the negative projection could be nonzero and possibly quite large while paths generally dont double back on themselves using a this transition speed would effectively make the robot go too fast past the transition point and not change direction at the right location that would be a bug

the simulatedtest fixture ideally should reset the dynamicparameters for the entire system before each test case is run in case they get modified during a test and we dont want them affecting the next one

this cant easily be done until  is complete and dynamic paramters are injected as dependencies into the code the current code still relies on accessing the parameters globally somewhat which is why this change cant be made currently trying to change the global pointer value results in sigabrt because memory addresses change

once  is complete the dynamicparamters should be recreated in the setup function of the simulatedtest class

once  is implemented the simulator class will handle less of its own timing and provide an interface thats easier to work with

some previous problems weve had with the simulated tests are that if things run slowly or someone is debugging and stops at a breakpoint the threadedobservers will time out because they rely on wallclock timeouts

we can change the simulatedtestfixture to handle connecting the components itself without the threaded observers it can connect the simulatorbackend to the ai to worldstatevalidator and back to the backend in a singlethreaded loop that way we still get determinism but have less timingrelated issues this will also let the tests shut down sooner on failure since again they dont have to wait for a timeout

as per discussion in  there are several new features the dynmicparameter system will provide that requires an update to the yaml schema
 const parameters
 sharing parameters with lower levels
 support for enum types and possibly factory types
 optional parameters aka can be null or have no value

we need to design a new yaml schema to support these new features this ticket is just for the schema not the implementation  scripting

in order to support enums directly in the new dynamicparameter system we need to know what header the enum is defined in so it can be included in the autogenerated code

one way of solving this is using export in the build file with the desired header and then depending on it as data however imo export is not very clear about ifwhere the file is being used and in the context of the module itself it doesnt make sense for random header files to be exported

another option is to create a custom bazel rule that given dependency targets can output the header files that are part of that target this can then be consumed as data by the main scripts we will need to see if the complexity of a custom rule is worth it but this should be a bit more clear than exporting files

 being able to register a callback with a nonmutable parameter for example in nearly all cases we dont want code to be able to set parameter values itself but its totally reasonable for that code to want to listen for changes to those values and bind callbacks currently we cant do this because the registercallback function is nonconst meaning the nonmutable dynamicparameters cant use that function since dynamicparameters are const  this may necessitate two different parameter types to enforce mutability  nonmutability rather than relying solely on const

 being able to register a callback for when any value in an entire config changes eg i want to reinit networking code when a networking param changes but i dont want to enumerate all the parameters and register a callback for each

no strong preference for if this is for the parameters that are immediate children of the config of if this recursively applies to all subconfigs too whichever is easier i cant think of a usecase that demands one or the other atm

this would be a nice qualityoflife improvement and help keep some code smallercleaner by not manually registering a function to a bunch of params

currently the backend folder is split between input and output with the idea that input is data coming into the software stack and output is the data thats sent out from the software stack this is not actually the case however with radiooutput also serving the role of receiving data from the robots 

some ideas include
 separating out input from radiooutput
 restructuring input output folders in backend to some other division such as ssl msgs vs robot communication
 removing the hierarchy

some thoughts
 the protomulticastlistener can listen to tbotsrobotmsgs so that can all fit in the input folder
 mrf cant be neatly separated on an inputoutput basis since the annunciator receives robot msgs so its an input is a part of radiooutput

additionally robotstatus should be moved to the radio folder since it will no longer be used outside of radio

ssl gamecontroller has a ci mode that we could use to handle all the validation of the ssl rules as opposed to writing validation functions ourselves this may also require running a refbox

investigate to see how easy it would be to use and if the complexity of integration is worth it

pros
 use the most uptodate rules as defined by the ssl no bugs from us miswriting rules
 easy to update for rule changes by downloading a new binary
 we dont have to write any functions for ssl rules

cons
 possibly more complexity to integrate
 possibly harder to use to debug if messages and failure modes arent clear

need help brainstorming solutions to a problem we found last week with sim please leave any thoughts  ideas

problem
the robots can only defend the negativex side of the field because we currently dont let the ai tell the robots where they are as of right now robots get their current position  orientation directly from the physics sim both for accuracy and fidelity ie those values will be updated much faster than ai would send them

however this means that robots always get their absolute global coordinates and not the ones from ai that may be flipped to account for what side we are defending as a result robots can only defend the negative side right now

possible solution add invert flag for each team in sim that would flip the physics coordinates
pros
 keep the fidelity and accuracy of physics
cons
 another place a flag has to be set outside the ai a bit more complex to get things set up

possible solution listen to ai streamed vision data
pros
 works like our irl system and lets ai control everything as expected
cons
 severe loss of fidelity primitives and control may not work as well because they will update several times without the robots known position changing to combat this we may have to write our own stateestimation system which would add a lot of complexity

possible solution listen to ai streamed vision data and set internal invert flag based on that
if most positions are mirrored between physics and ai data set the invert flag for the simulated team

pros
 keep the fidelity and accuracy of physics
 doesnt add any new controls generally works like our irl system from the pov of ai
cons
 just feels a bit odd
 if there was only  robot on the field may break down if the robot is atnear   because we dont know if its mirrored or not

the current geometry utilities are fragmented so one of the goals is to make them more uniform and crosscompatible as a part of the geom redesign implement the currently used geom functions in a util file backing this with boost geometry may be the solution

this issue should also update function names and comments from the old geometry utilities as some of the function names  comments were found to be either difficult to understand or wrong some other clean up actions for the old geom util are included under acceptance criteria as well as guidelines for designing and implementing new geom util

some notes from preyear planning regarding util redesign

more print operators for geometry shapes
clean up polygon
enforce that polygon is not crossed over itself in constructor
maybe not an issues if we use boost
make rectangle and triangle subclass polygon
look into replacing all geometry functions with boost implementations
can we just typedef our types
separate angle and angularvelocity classes
separate point and vector classes

a physicsrobot is currently made up of  main components
 the body
 the chicker
 the dribbler

the chicker is a very thin sliver that sits at the back of the dribbler and exists for the purpose of triggering autokickchip callbacks we dont really need an entire extra fixture just to trigger specific callbacks which can reasonably be triggered by the dribbler theres no real benefit to having the trigger point a cm or so further back in the robot this is technically slightly closer to where the breakbeam will activate in real life but its a pretty small difference

removing the chicker and combining its callback functionality with the dribbler fixture would remove some code complexity from the physicsrobot code mostly in setting up fixtures and contactlistener

need help brainstorming solutions to a problem we found last week with sim please leave any thoughts  ideas

problem
the robots can only defend the negativex side of the field because we currently dont let the ai tell the robots where they are as of right now robots get their current position  orientation directly from the physics sim both for accuracy and fidelity ie those values will be updated much faster than ai would send them

however this means that robots always get their absolute global coordinates and not the ones from ai that may be flipped to account for what side we are defending as a result robots can only defend the negative side right now

possible solution add invert flag for each team in sim that would flip the physics coordinates
pros
 keep the fidelity and accuracy of physics
cons
 another place a flag has to be set outside the ai a bit more complex to get things set up

possible solution listen to ai streamed vision data
pros
 works like our irl system and lets ai control everything as expected
cons
 severe loss of fidelity primitives and control may not work as well because they will update several times without the robots known position changing to combat this we may have to write our own stateestimation system which would add a lot of complexity

possible solution listen to ai streamed vision data and set internal invert flag based on that
if most positions are mirrored between physics and ai data set the invert flag for the simulated team

pros
 keep the fidelity and accuracy of physics
 doesnt add any new controls generally works like our irl system from the pov of ai
cons
 just feels a bit odd
 if there was only  robot on the field may break down if the robot is atnear   because we dont know if its mirrored or not

the ballfilter does not properly remove robots if getfiltereddata is called with an empty vector

this can and should be reproduced with a unit test before fixing to make sure it does indeed get fixed and to prevent future regressions

file softwaresensorfusionfilterrobotfiltercpp

in getfiltereddata if the function is called with an empty vector the first loop does not run therefore when we get to the datanum   check we still have the temporary latesttimestamp timestamp that was created above because this value is  it will never be greater than the expiry buffer  the latest robot timestamp so the function will never return stdnullopt indicating the robot is no longer detected instead it will always return the most recent robot state stored by the class

this should be fixed so that robots that do not appear in a detection for longer than the expiry buffer get reported as nonexistent by the robotfilter even when the function is called with an empty vector repeatedly

some of our simulation unit tests are designed not just to validate basic functionality but actually to help us tune certain behavior in simulation

for example all the various dribbling tests in simulatorrobotsingletontestcpp are not only designed to make sure dribbling works at all but to help us tune various values in the implementation and other simulation values for example if we define that the robot should be able to rotate at  before it loses the ball we can use one of the unit tests to make sure thats the case and tune force values in the implementation accordingly to get that desired behavior

however this means that these tests need to effectively be set up the same as the actual simulator standalone and simulated tests there are values such as
 physics time step
 various restitution values
 various friction values

that can affect the behavior of dribbling and therefore should be consistent between the tests and real simulation if they are not then the tests are not as meaningful because a unit test may say we can dribble the ball up to  but that may not be the case in the simulated tests

currently some of these values are shared because they are static constexpr class constants most friction and restitution values fall under this category except for the ball

however the physics time step is not shared between the tests and real simulation the timestep has a large impact on how well the robot can keep control of the ball while dribbling because the dribbler is so small the more chances we have to apply force even if small the better control we have

eg the robot can spin with the ball up until about  rads with a  time step however the robot can spin with the ball at about  rads with a  timestep

therefore we should find a way to share the physics timestep between the tests and actual simulator both the standalone sim and simulated tests or find another solution such that we can have tests that help us tune the desired behavior of certain features in the simulation

a physicsrobot is currently made up of  main components
 the body
 the chicker
 the dribbler

the chicker is a very thin sliver that sits at the back of the dribbler and exists for the purpose of triggering autokickchip callbacks we dont really need an entire extra fixture just to trigger specific callbacks which can reasonably be triggered by the dribbler theres no real benefit to having the trigger point a cm or so further back in the robot this is technically slightly closer to where the breakbeam will activate in real life but its a pretty small difference

removing the chicker and combining its callback functionality with the dribbler fixture would remove some code complexity from the physicsrobot code mostly in setting up fixtures and contactlistener

after some bugs with  we learned some new stuff about how coroutine contexts work and how the coroutine stack interacts with the normal stack and heap this should really be documented so other people understand this as well

tldr the coroutine stack is different from the normal stack and they do not interact however the coroutine stack can interact fine with the heap therefore if there are variables the coroutine needs to access and have updated externally they must either be injected when the coroutine is constructed and bound or the variables must be on the heap

being able to set the ball velocity from the gui is very useful to set up various test scenarios for the ai especially in combination with the simulators pause feature

there are many ways this could be done from a uiux perspective so here are some options
 click and drag the ball to set the velocity when the mouse button is released the balls velocity would be set to the vector formed by the clickanddrag so its like slingshotting the ball

ssl gamecontroller has a ci mode that we could use to handle all the validation of the ssl rules as opposed to writing validation functions ourselves this may also require running a refbox

investigate to see how easy it would be to use and if the complexity of integration is worth it

pros
 use the most uptodate rules as defined by the ssl no bugs from us miswriting rules
 easy to update for rule changes by downloading a new binary
 we dont have to write any functions for ssl rules

cons
 possibly more complexity to integrate
 possibly harder to use to debug if messages and failure modes arent clear

for context a theoretical test setup with the gamecontroller might look like
 run the gamecontroller alongside the simulated test executable
 for every simulated camera frame send that information over the network to the gamecontroller
 block until the gamecontroller sends an update back and check for any faults or errors eg gamecontroller reports robot collision or a max speed violation
 continue until all validation functions pass or the test times out

 edit possibly superseded by  this ticket is on hold until  is resolved

a core component of our soontobe simulated testing system is the ability to validate what the robots and ai do 

 added validation functions which are the functions we use to validate behavior in simulated tests at a highlevel there are two types
 timeinvariant conditions
 timevariant conditions

this ticket will focus on writing timeinvariant validation functions for any ssl rules that apply

these validation functions will be used in our larger simulated testing framework  example of its usage can be found in srcsoftwaresimulatedtests

action items
 read the 
 create a list of rules that we can implement as timeinvariant validation functions
 check the list with mathewmacdougall or post in slack for more public discussion
 once each rule is okd add it as an acceptance criteria below this ticket will be used to track all rules we are adding rather than making a ticket for each
 for each rule
     implement it
     test it if necessary some will be simple enough they dont need additional tests others may be complicated enough they will use your best judgement
     open a pr to add that validation function note that were doing one rule  function per pr to keep them smaller and more manageable

to start lets put the validation functions in a new srcsoftwaresimulatedtestsvalidationfunctions folder we should be able to put these all in a file called sslrules or similar

we are noticing several situations where we want to pass a dynamicparameter config into a class on construction however if this class is part of a factory this becomes much more difficult if each object in the factory requires a different config for example this is an issue passing configs to various backends via the genericfactory or to plays

factories that require the same parameter
 backends

factories that require different parameters
 plays

some solutions that have been considered
static class functions that return the correct subconfig from some toplevel config
 only works if there is a toplevel config
 may require the entire toplevel config to be mocked for tests which isnt good if it contains other things not needed by the factory constructors

manually registering things in factories rather than using the generic one
 slightly more work to add  remove factory items and requires slightly more knowledge of factories
 more obvious whats going on
 in the case of plays multiple factories  levels of factories could be used like playbooks

this ticket is to discuss and figure out the best way to handle these cases so that we can dependency inject configs into factorycreated objects

the passgenerator currently uses adam to optimize for better receive locations and pass speeds
we put each pass through  iterations of gradient descent and we do that for every pass over  zones however the pass rating improvement from   to  to  iterations isnt significant enough to justify the time  resources needed

we are trading off between the speed of finding a good enough pass and finding a really good pass since the field is highly dynamic optimizing on outdated data is always bad

here are some plots of how the score improves more details can be found at the bottom of the page here 


 iterations take  ms each for a total of  passes which adds up to 
 iterations take  each for a total of  passes which adds up to 

in the corner kick play  iterations per pass results in a pass w a score  and  iterations results in a pass w a score of 

so ive temporarily set the max iterations to  but we should find the sweet spot by tuning step sizes and weights

this zeroing out behavior is also the reason why most initial random samples have a really bad score and are not able to improve our optimizer looks at the gradient of ratepass around the initial input pass and if the gradient is  around it it doesnt have enough context to know which way to nudge the input to improve the pass rating

  currently our score is mostly  across the entire field except for very specific regions around the robots attach a before and after shot of the improvement to ratepass we can visually verify the cost function improved if the score is spread out more
  make sure that onetouch shots are still favored but receiveanddribble passes should still be doable

when running fullsystem closing the visualizer and shutting down causes a segfault most of the time an example is shown below

i am reasonably confident it has to do with how dynamicparameters are deallocated with all the observer threads since the segfault stack trace always seems to involve a dynamicparameter in some way and the reproduction is nondeterministic

this may be resolved by  and should be investigated afterwards

when the simualtorgui or fullsystemgui start up we make sure to focus the visualization contents on the field this can be thought of as the default view

as users zoom and pan around the scene they may want a quick way to reset the view back to the entire field this would be the purpose of a resetview button

this can likely be implemented in the drawfunctionvisualizer since its used for both the fullsystemgui or simulatorgui this could either be implemented with a button or a context menu item the menu that appears during a rightclick

floating point errors can be detected automatically by adding feenableexceptfeinvalid  feoverflow to the main function or where it has to be called eg in the simulated test fixture constructor more info

there are floating point exception errors that we ignore eg sqrt of a negative number overflow etc the most visible way this fails is when it causes the robot state to contain nans not a number which causes robot costs to be nans which causes the munkres algorithm and consequently ai to stall 

floating point errors can be detected automatically by adding feenableexceptfeinvalid  feoverflow to the main function or where it has to be called eg in the simulated test fixture constructor more info
 
 

currently every simulated test suffers from at least one floating point exception error typically in physics or primitives functions

there is an implicit requirement that our robot controllerfirmware runs at least as fast as the shortest timesegment in a trajectoryplanner planned trajectory

 this will divide the path into  segments notably for control purposes each segment corresponds to a single control command eg accelerate coast decelerate therefore shorter paths will have shorter segments and therefore there will be less time between each segment

if the firmwarecontrol is running slower than the trajectoryplanner needs it to  this is so that we dont execute old control commands if we are already ahead however skipping control commands can result in the robots moving very slowly especially if we skip some acceleration or coast commands and decelerate instead

this is what we observed currently in simulation with our custom simulator on the latest master commit  at the time of writing

we simulate our firmware at  however for certain short motions especially pivots the difference in time between segments is sometimes   seconds this causes the robots to sometimes pivot really slowly

to fix this we need a stronger guarantee that we wont end up with timesegments smaller than the max speed we can run control the ideal fix for this is likely to calculate the number of segments a pathtrajectory should have so that shorter paths get divided into fewer segments avoiding tiny segments and therefore tiny unachievable timesteps

i tried changing the type of the channel param from int to uint but then get the following error


 error no match for operator operand types are mutableparameterlist aka stdvector  stdsharedptr stdallocator    stdsharedptr  stdsharedptr  stdsharedptr stdallocator    stdsharedptr   and 
         
         


this occurs even when just building the cppconfigtest so isnt related to the types of the variables using the param in the actual code

we should investigate this issue and then change the channel params in networkconfigyaml and fullsystemmaincommandlineargsconfigyaml to be uint

a weakness of our goalie tactic is that the goalie pushes out to the crease defenders too much making it much harder to go back to a good position if the opponent passes across the field and attempts a one touch shot find a better positioning for the goalie so this doesnt happen

the jetson nano doesnt have a screen and monitoring tshark or the router page to figure what ip it got is pretty annoying to do repeatedly we need a more robust way of knowing which robots are online and what ip they received 

a simple solution is for the robot to broadcast a packet on that network indicating that its online with some useful information

  write a python program that broadcasts a packet on the network
  define a proto for the broadcast packet it should contain robot id robot ip mac address to begin with
  broadcast packet every  seconds you should figure out how to get the broadcast ip programatically
  write a corresponding python function that can run on the hostai computer that blocks for  seconds and returns all the protos that were broadcasted

this ticket involves implementing the networkservice portion of thunderloop

this service needs to receive primitives and vision from ai and update the local buffers in thunderloop it also needs to pack up all the statues and send out robotstatus msgs

the networkservice should implement the service interface see softwarejetsonnanoservicesserviceh and it should make use of the softwarenetworking libraries 

its worth quickly learning about udptcp and multicast vs unicast also wifibackend is a good place to look for all the incomingoutgoing protobufs in ai

we choose which play to run by checking whether playisapplicable is true in our current gameplay then we keep running the play as long as playinvariantholds is true this means that playisapplicable should normally be more restrictive than playinvariantholds

it would be very weird if we had a situation where playinvariantholds is false when playisapplicable is true so we should know when that happens

use the logger module to log a debug message when this behaviour happens during our gameplay it probably makes the most sense to write this message in stpcalculatenewplay but maybe stpupdateaiplay makes more sense

backspin chipping is something we may want to make use of that we dont get for free in simulation because we simulate in  we need to figure out how to simulate backspin chipping this would require changes in the physics layer of the simulator mostly to the physicsball and physicsrobot classes

possible ideas
 create a model of how backspin chipping at different speeds affects the ball in real life then use this model to apply forces to the ball to simulate this realworld behavior eg apply a force  impulse to the ball when it lands proportional to how much backspin it has to slow the ball down
 create a simple internal model similar to above but make it ideal rather than trying to model reallife behavior eg dribbling with less than  rpm has no effect  slows the ball down  causes the all to land and go in reverse back to the robot

this should really only be implemented if backspin chipping is something we plan to make use of in our strategy check with jonathanlew akhilveeraghanta and the software team prior to delving too deep

 description of the task


    define the task in one sentence
    if you cannot write the task in a sentence perhaps the task is too large
    and you should divide it down further

currently we had to disable accounting for friendly robots when estimating the number of passes is would take a robot to receive a pass from whichever robot currently has the ball because it caused oscillations in the defense when a friendly robot moved to block the pass this changes where the pass may be received from so the robot moves again and oscillates

we should figure out a way around this if we still think its worth accounting for is there a smart way to ignore the robot marking an enemy receiver without making the code more complicated

our current bangbang controller is very nearly an openloop control algorithm it essentially assumes that the force it applies to the robots wheels is what it expects and the controller gain and other constants have been tuned for onfield performance as a result robots tend to overshoot their destinations in our simulator

in order to compensate for this we have increased the values for linear and angular robot damping in the simulation to a point where the robots will not significantly overshoot their destinations

one the new pid  spline controller is implemented by evanmorcom  we should have a proper control algorithm with feedback that should be more robust to these damping constants or well know better values to approximate specific robot dynamics used in the model for control

the values to change are robotlineardamping and robotangulardamping in physicsroboth their original values were  and were somewhat arbitrary the values should be returned to something reasonable near that value

currently all robots aka agents in the hrvo simulator use the hrvo algorithm to avoid collision and go towards their goal position however in real life not all dynamic objects will be trying to avoid other obstacles for example we do not know the behaviour of the enemy robots and as a result predicting their movement using hrvo is likely to be inaccurate thus we will be assuming that the enemy robots will be moving at a constant velocity this will also be useful for avoiding the ball when it is an obstacle since the ball will not be trying to dodge our robots

we have to build this functionality into thunderscope this ticket involves building a chicker interface this is what the current system looks like



here charge will charge the high voltage capacitors allowing you to select the power before clicking kick which will kick the ball and chip to chip the ball  

we also have the addition of the geneva  drive which allows us to select  discrete angles to kick at



so we need to build a ui that can look something like this



everything will be grayed out initially and when you press the charge button everything else will be available to click on

then you click on kickchip just have the widget print the current value of the slider for now we will need to update the code to eventually send the command to the robots to perform that action

known issue introduced in  with the initial robot placement feature

 however this doesnt fix the original issue of robot placement not being updated visually while the simulator is paused this is because these updates only happen at the end of a physics tick to synchronize with the  world but that doesnt happen during pause

we need to find a way to show the updated locations of robots being placed while the simulator is paused

this may not be possible due to how most robot and ball updates are currently done in summary
 when the simulator is requested to set the position of a robot or ball this action is stored in a queue actions in this queue are then run in order after each  physics step the reason for this is that we must make sure we dont mutate the physics world in the middle of a physics step otherwise the program will crash  has internal checks for these mutations and will abort the program
 if the simulator is in the pause state there will be no physics updates occurring meaning this action queue will not be processed therefore the robot  ball will not actually be moved until simulation starts again

we explicitly chose not to manually trigger an additional physics update because this could lead to slightly strange behavior one would not expect simulation to occur at all during pause and depending where its invoked from could bypass any internal timing systems in the simulator

it may be possible to do a zerotime physics step so that the poststep action queue can be processed but effectively nothing changes and simulated time does not move forwards ie call  this would need to be investigated

some of our simulation unit tests are designed not just to validate basic functionality but actually to help us tune certain behavior in simulation

for example all the various dribbling tests in simulatorrobotsingletontestcpp are not only designed to make sure dribbling works at all but to help us tune various values in the implementation and other simulation values for example if we define that the robot should be able to rotate at  before it loses the ball we can use one of the unit tests to make sure thats the case and tune force values in the implementation accordingly to get that desired behavior

however this means that these tests need to effectively be set up the same as the actual simulator standalone and simulated tests there are values such as
 physics time step
 various restitution values
 various friction values

that can affect the behavior of dribbling and therefore should be consistent between the tests and real simulation if they are not then the tests are not as meaningful because a unit test may say we can dribble the ball up to  but that may not be the case in the simulated tests

currently some of these values are shared because they are static constexpr class constants most friction and restitution values fall under this category except for the ball

however the physics time step is not shared between the tests and real simulation the timestep has a large impact on how well the robot can keep control of the ball while dribbling because the dribbler is so small the more chances we have to apply force even if small the better control we have

eg the robot can spin with the ball up until about  rads with a  time step however the robot can spin with the ball at about  rads with a  timestep

therefore we should find a way to share the physics timestep between the tests and actual simulator both the standalone sim and simulated tests or find another solution such that we can have tests that help us tune the desired behavior of certain features in the simulation

currently the enemy ball placement play can be quite aggressive when shadowing the enemy robot placing the ball this leads to the placing robot being impeded which can result in a penalty according to the ssl rulebook it seems that shadowing is most aggressive when the enemy robot is moving towards the ball to pick it up after the enemy robot picks up the ball we no longer shadow as aggressively

robot diagnostics is a tool used by all subteams to make sure the robots are working robot diagnostics can exercise the kickerchipper the high voltage capacitors and all  motors

we have to build this functionality into thunderscope this ticket involves building a chicker interface this is what the current system looks like



here charge will charge the high voltage capacitors allowing you to select the power before clicking kick which will kick the ball and chip to chip the ball  

we also have the addition of the geneva  drive which allows us to select  discrete angles to kick at



so we need to build a ui that can look something like this



everything will be grayed out initially and when you press the charge button everything else will be available to click on

then you click on kickchip just have the widget print the current value of the slider for now we will need to update the code to eventually send the command to the robots to perform that action

  create a new widget with  sliders and  buttons as explained above
  figure out how to disableenable buttons gray them out when they cant be pressed
  when charge is clicked enable the rest of the buttons and gray out charge this is because we need the capicators to be charge to kick or chip
  when any other buttons are clicked disable everything but charge this is because once we kickchip we discharge the caps and they need to be charged again

so we use a  opengl widget and limit the mouse movements to not include any  orbitrotations

currently we also limit zooming in and out using the scroll wheel because the grid would need scale with the zoom based on the fov and other things we would also need to adjust the axis markings to scale accordingly similar to how the grid lines on the field widget currently automatically scale

here is one approach feel free to find bettereasier implementations

  create a new protobuf message which includes a map of friendly robot ids to the robots hrvosimulator protobuf message explained above
  create an overlay to the field widget which has a selection to choose between robot ids to showcase one optionally can show more of the hrvo simulator protobuf messages the implementation of this should be very similar to the implementation of the existing obstacle overlay
